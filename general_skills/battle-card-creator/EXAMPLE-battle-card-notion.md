### Neutralize Confluence Strengths

**"Confluence has better enterprise permissions"**
- **Reframe**: "Notion's permissions cover 90% of use cases with less complexity. For most teams, simpler permissions mean faster collaboration without IT bottlenecks."
- **Counter**: "We're rapidly expanding enterprise features. What specific permission requirements do you have? We can show if Notion meets them today."
- **Question**: "How often do your team members actually need the advanced permission scenarios? Would a simpler system increase adoption?"

**"We're already using Jira/Atlassian tools"**
- **Reframe**: "Notion integrates with Jira while also providing documentation in a tool people enjoy using. Many teams use both—Jira for issue tracking, Notion for everything else."
- **Counter**: "Atlassian lock-in can limit flexibility. Notion offers an API and 2,000+ integrations, giving you more options as needs evolve."
- **Question**: "Are your non-engineering teams comfortable using Confluence? We often see adoption challenges outside dev teams."

### Our Strengths vs OneNote

1. **Structured Collaboration**
   - Purpose-built for team collaboration vs personal note-taking
   - Better organization with databases and relations
   - Real-time presence and commenting

- **Reframe**: "While included, OneNote's feature set is limited for team collaboration. Organizations often add tools like SharePoint or Teams to fill gaps—creating new costs and complexity."
- **Counter**: "Notion's free tier is generous for small teams. For larger teams, the added capabilities (databases, integrations, templates) justify the cost through efficiency gains."
- **Question**: "What's the real cost of switching between OneNote, SharePoint, Teams, and other tools? How much time could you save with a unified workspace?"

**"We need handwriting support for tablets"**
- **Acknowledge**: "Notion doesn't support handwriting yet. For users who need inking, OneNote or a hybrid approach might work better."
- **Alternative**: "Many teams use OneNote for handwritten notes and Notion for typed documentation and collaboration. They work well together."

## Handling Common Objections

### Objection: "Confluence has better enterprise features"
**Response**: Notion has been rapidly expanding enterprise capabilities including SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning, advanced permissions, and audit logs. For most organizations, our enterprise features meet requirements while maintaining the ease of use that drives adoption.

**Discovery Questions**:
- What specific enterprise features are must-haves for your team?
- How important is user adoption vs. administrative control?
- Would you like to see a comparison of Notion's current enterprise features?

**Proof Point**: 70% of Fortune 500 companies use Notion; enterprises like Figma, Pixar, and Toyota trust Notion for mission-critical documentation

---

### Objection: "We're already paying for Microsoft 365, OneNote is free"
**Response**: While OneNote is included with Microsoft 365, it's designed for individual note-taking rather than team collaboration. Organizations often find they need additional tools (SharePoint, Lists, Teams) to fill collaboration gaps, creating hidden costs in tool sprawl and reduced productivity from context switching.

**Reframe**: "The question isn't 'Is OneNote free?' but 'What's the total cost of your current documentation and collaboration stack?' Notion often reduces overall costs by consolidating multiple tools."

**Proof Point**: Teams report 20-30% time savings from using one tool instead of juggling OneNote, SharePoint, Planner, and Teams for different tasks

---

### Objection: "Our development team needs tight Jira integration"
**Response**: Notion integrates with Jira through our API and third-party tools, allowing you to link Jira issues in Notion docs. Many development teams use both—Jira for issue tracking and sprints, Notion for everything else (product specs, architecture docs, team wikis, onboarding).

**Reframe**: "Most of your organization isn't using Jira. Should your documentation tool be optimized for developers or for cross-functional collaboration?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- How many people in your organization actually use Jira daily?
- What pain points exist with Confluence for non-engineering teams?
- Would separating issue tracking (Jira) from documentation (Notion) create problems or clarity?

---

### Objection: "Notion doesn't work offline"
**Response**: Notion does work offline, though with some limitations. For most knowledge workers with reliable internet, this isn't a daily concern. For teams that need robust offline functionality, we can discuss workarounds or acknowledge if another tool is a better fit.

**Discovery Questions**:
- How often are team members actually offline for extended periods?
- What specific workflows need offline access?
- Would mobile hotspots or better connectivity solve the core need?

**Acknowledge When Not a Fit**: For field teams or roles with frequent extended offline periods, Notion may not be ideal today

---

### Objection: "Notion is too flexible—our team needs structure"
**Response**: This is actually a strength with the right approach. Notion's flexibility means you can enforce as much or as little structure as needed. Many teams use templates and locked pages to create standardized processes while still allowing customization where it helps.

**Counter**: "Would you rather have a tool that's too rigid (forcing workarounds) or one that's flexible (requiring thoughtful setup)? With templates and permissions, Notion can be as structured as you need."

**Proof Point**: Share case study of similar company that created standardized templates and processes in Notion

---

### Objection: "We need better security/compliance"
**Response**: Notion is SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and offers enterprise features including SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning, and audit logs. We take security seriously and work with Fortune 500 companies in regulated industries.

**Discovery Questions**:
- What specific security or compliance requirements do you have?
- Are there certifications or controls that are must-haves?
- Have you reviewed our security and compliance documentation?

**Proof Point**: Provide link to Notion's security whitepaper and compliance page
