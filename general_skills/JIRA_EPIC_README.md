# Jira Epic Creator Skill

Transform any document into a structured Jira epic with comprehensive user stories following your organization's 5-section template.

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you:

1. **Convert documents to Jira epics** - Transform requirements docs, proposals, or any document into properly structured epics
2. **Follow your epic template** - Ensures all 5 required sections are included and complete
3. **Break down into stories** - Automatically generates user stories with acceptance criteria
4. **Analyze documents** - Extracts problems, solutions, metrics, and stakeholders from text
5. **Ensure quality** - Enforces best practices for epic and story writing

## Epic Template (5 Required Sections)

Every epic created includes:

1. **Problem Statement or Opportunity Statement**
   - Who is affected, what the issue is, why it matters
   - Includes metrics and quantifiable impact

2. **Proposed Solution**
   - High-level approach and key features
   - Technical approaches and architecture notes

3. **What solutions exist today to address the problem / opportunity statement**
   - Current workarounds and their limitations
   - Competitor solutions
   - Why existing solutions are inadequate

4. **What does the final deliverable / impact for this project look like?**
   - Concrete deliverables (features, docs, etc.)
   - Quantified expected impact with metrics
   - Success criteria

5. **Additional Information for Support Requested**
   - Dependencies on other teams/projects
   - Resource requirements (engineers, designers, etc.)
   - Links to research, designs, docs
   - Risks and constraints

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Upload or paste your document**
   ```
   "Here's a requirements document for a new feature. Create a Jira epic and stories."
   ```

2. **Claude will:**
   - Read and analyze the document
   - Extract key information (problems, solutions, metrics)
   - Create a complete epic with all 5 sections
   - Break it down into 10-20 user stories
   - Format everything for easy Jira import

3. **You get:**
   - Complete epic ready to copy into Jira
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Proper categorization (foundation, feature, quality stories)
   - Story dependencies and ordering

### What Gets Analyzed

The skill automatically extracts:
- **Problem indicators**: Issues, pain points, complaints
- **Solution proposals**: Implementations, features, approaches
- **Metrics**: Numbers, percentages, time savings, costs
- **Stakeholders**: Users, teams, roles mentioned
- **Existing solutions**: Current workflows and workarounds
- **Impact statements**: Benefits, outcomes, goals

### Story Breakdown

Stories are organized into categories:

**Foundation Stories** (build first):
- Data models and APIs
- Authentication/authorization
- Basic UI framework

**Feature Stories** (core value):
- User-facing functionality
- Vertical slices of features
- Incremental value delivery

**Enhancement Stories** (added value):
- Advanced features
- Performance improvements
- Nice-to-have functionality

**Quality Stories** (polish):
- Testing and QA
- Documentation
- Accessibility
- Performance optimization
