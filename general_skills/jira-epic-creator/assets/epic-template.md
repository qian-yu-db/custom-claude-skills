# [Epic Title: Brief Description of the Initiative]

## 1. Problem Statement or Opportunity Statement

[Clearly define the problem or opportunity. Answer: Who is affected? What is the issue? Why does it matter?]

**Example:**
> Our customer support team receives 200+ tickets per week asking how to export reports. This represents 40 hours of support time weekly. Users struggle to find the export functionality, leading to frustration and decreased product satisfaction scores (NPS dropped 5 points in Q3).

**Your Statement:**

## 2. Proposed Solution

[Describe the proposed approach to solve the problem. Include key features and technical approaches.]

**Example:**
> Implement a prominent "Export" button in the top-right of all report pages that opens a modal with export options (PDF, Excel, CSV). Add contextual help tooltips and a quick-start guide. Use the existing reporting API backend with new export format handlers.

**Your Solution:**

## 3. What solutions exist today to address the problem / opportunity statement

[Document current workarounds, competitor solutions, or existing features. Explain why they're inadequate.]

**Example:**
> Currently, users can:
> - Use browser "Print to PDF" (loses formatting, breaks on large reports)
> - Copy-paste data into Excel (time-consuming, error-prone)
> - Request exports from support team (slow, creates bottleneck)
> 
> Competitors like DataViz Pro offer one-click export with format selection, which our users cite as a key advantage.

## 4. What does the final deliverable / impact for this project look like?

[Define concrete deliverables and quantify expected impact with metrics.]

**Example:**
> **Deliverables:**
> - Export functionality on all 12 report types
> - Support for PDF, Excel, and CSV formats
> - In-app help documentation and tooltips
> - User guide video (2-3 minutes)
> 
> **Expected Impact:**
> - Reduce support tickets related to exports by 80% (from 200 to 40/week)
> - Improve NPS score by 3-5 points
> - Save 30+ support hours per week
> - Increase report usage by 25% (currently 2,000 reports/month)

## 5. Additional Information for Support Requested

[Include dependencies, resource requirements, relevant links, risks, and stakeholder information.]

**Example:**
> **Dependencies:**
> - Design team: 40 hours for mockups and user testing
> - Backend team: Integration with reporting API (estimated 2 sprints)
> - Dependency on Q4 API refactor project (blocks implementation)
> 
> **Resources:**
> - Frontend: 1 engineer, 3 sprints
> - QA: 1 tester, 1 sprint
> - PM: 20 hours coordination
> 
> **Links:**
> - User research findings: [link]
> - Competitor analysis: [link]
> - Technical design doc: [link]
> 
> **Risks:**
> - API performance may degrade with large exports (needs load testing)
> - PDF rendering library licensing costs ($5k/year)
